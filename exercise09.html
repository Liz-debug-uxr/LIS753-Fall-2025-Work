            <h2>About the Sale</h2>
            <p>
                We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our monthly sale. These are mostly from donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We also sell items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases.

            <h2>Children's Books and Bargain Books</h2>
            <p>
                Children's books, music, videos, and toys are in our new room near the Cubberley track, Pavilion, and the Greendell School. You'll find many items for 50 cents or $1, including picture books, school-age fiction and nonfiction, non-English language books, CDs, DVDs, and books for parents and teachers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are $1, paperbacks are 50 cents, and children's books are just 25 cents. On Sunday, prices in the bargain room are half-off. You can save even more by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and filling them with books.
